1. Research:

Research on Api's 
How to run multiple api's in one script
Can I put api's into a function and call them 
What Apis should use 


2. create fn

create functions that run the different api 
before putting them into the project
plan more steps

3. create fn for each api 

extract data from association api
store it into an array 

check that api has one word 

4. Code actual game
done


5. structure code 
- learn about structure
  * separation of concern SoC
  * MVP and MVC
- put into separate file into folders
  * fetch api go into one folders
  * components go into another folder
  * assets -css go into another folder
  * time goes into one folder 

- moduled files with import and export 
  * started with timer and it worked after tinkering with it for bit
  * putting fetch into module is to complicated for now.. i can get the data out 
  * try asyn await:
    https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/711uto/storing_api_fetch_data_in_a_variable/
    as in the last comment here. storing the data in a variable 
  * they way I ahve been doing it isn't ideal but maybe async is the way to go
    https://www.py4u.net/discuss/306376
  * more async stuff

- module inside the app with APP =, FETCH = etc.


6. debug file 
word from before translates drags over to the next


6. design & create
- design better start page
- just have two pages 
- front page with high score and name etc.
- actual gmae page


7. private api key

https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/private-api-keys/
- implement this solution 

Fn: 

come up with the logic of the functions 

Both API's are free 

Good explaination and example

Api random word finder
https://rapidapi.com/sheharyar566/api/random-words5/

Api word Association 
https://wordassociations.net/en

convert fetch into async await function 



8. add features 
- display content differently 
  * draw out ideas 
  * color animation 
  * instead of squares have circles 


9. write script that finds words i json that are adverbs and removes them
